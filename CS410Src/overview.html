If there is one thing that I feel very strongly about, it is that
software must be documented.  I also feel that it is very important
that student be exposed to sample code when learning a programming
language.  To those ends, I have written a number of sample Java
classes that demonstrate the concepts and APIs that we discuss in
class.  These classes are documented using Java documentation comments
and HTML pages have been generated from them using <a
